# Comments

This was a really difficult assignment for me and I definitely struggled with it,
but using the extra study resources on canvas and the links above helped me to
figure some things out, in addition to just trial and error in the console and
developer tools. JavaScript still feels really overwhelming and confusing to me,
but hopefully I didn't make too many errors or mistakes on this assignment.
