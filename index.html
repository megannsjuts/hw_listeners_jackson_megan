		<p>Cactus is the singular word for the plant, cacti or cactuses are the plural forms.
			Cacti are native to the Americas, ranging from Patagonia in South America through to areas of western Canada.
			One species, Rhipsalis baccifera, is the exception, it is also found in tropical Africa, Madagascar and Sri Lanka.
			It is thought that droppings from migratory birds dispersed the Rhipsalis seed in these other lands.
			The cactus generally lives in dry places prone to drought, such as deserts. There are 1,500 to 1,800 species of cacti.
			Each species for the most part fall into one of two core cacti categories, these being opuntias or cactoids.
			The spines (thorns, stickers) of a cactus are highly modified versions of plant leaves,
			there are very few cacti species with true plant leaves. These sharp spines and the thick tough skin of the stem help
			to protect the cactus from animals who would otherwise have easy access to the liquid inside.
			In the early 1800s when cacti were first taken back to Europe they were cultivated as ornamental plants.
			Rare species were often sold to collectors for very high prices.
			Today cacti continue to be grown as houseplants as they are pretty easy to grow and maintain.
